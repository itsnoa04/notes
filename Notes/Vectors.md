# **vectors are values with direction**

numbers are always used to represent something else.

Numberlines can be used to represent the continuity of numbers or a various array of items.

The direction of 1D vectors can be represented by sign(x)

sign(x) = -1 || 1

0 vector has no direction

abs(x) = length/ magnetude

abs --> absolute vectors

substraction of 1D vectors can be done by flipping its direction

distance(a,b) = abs(b-a)
