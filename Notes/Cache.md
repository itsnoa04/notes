A piece of hardware or software that stores data in order to retrieve it faster than would otherwise be possible.
Caches are frequently used to store network responses as well as the results of computationally intensive operations. It is important to note that data in a cache can become stale if the primary source of truth for that data (i.e., the primary database behind the cache) is updated but the cache is not.
