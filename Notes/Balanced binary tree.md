A [[binary tree]] with nodes that all have left and right subtrees that differ in height by no more than one.
A balanced [[binary tree]] maintains the logarithmic time complexity of its operations.
Inserting a node at the bottom of the left subtree of the following imbalanced [[binary tree]], for example, would clearly not be a logarithmic-time operation because it would require traversing through the majority of the tree's nodes:
