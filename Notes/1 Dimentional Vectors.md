Numberlines can be used to represent the continuity of numbers or a various [[array]] of items.

The direction of 1D [[vectors]] can be represented by sign(x)
```
sign(x) = -1 || 1
```

0 vector has no direction
```
abs(x) = length/ magnetude
```

abs --> absolute [[vectors]]

## Substraction of [[vectors]]

![[Pasted image 20220912183212.png]]

substraction of 1D [[vectors]] can be done by flipping its direction

```
distance(a,b) = abs(b-a)

a-b = a + (-b)
```

## Adition of 1D [[vectors]]

addition of two [[vectors]] is done by putting two [[vectors]] together

Addition is to **offset** and to multiply is to **scale**
