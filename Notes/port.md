They choose a port to listen on in order for multiple programmes on the same machine to listen for new network connections without colliding. A port is an integer between 0 and 65,535 in length (216 ports total).
Ports 0-1023 are typically reserved for system ports (also known as well-known ports) and should not be used by user-level processes. Certain ports have pre-defined uses, and while you won't be required to memorise them, they can come in handy on occasion. Here are a few examples:

• 22: Secure Shell
• 53: DNS lookup
• 80: HTTP
• 443: HTTPS
