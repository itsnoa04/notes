A content delivery network (CDN) is a third-party service that acts as a [[cache]] for your servers. When your servers are only in another region, web applications may be slow for users in that region. Because a CDN has servers all over the world, the latency to a CDN's servers is almost always far better than the latency to your servers. The servers of a CDN are frequently referred to as points of presence (PoPs) (Points of Presence). Cloudflare and Google Cloud CDN are two of the most popular CDNs.
